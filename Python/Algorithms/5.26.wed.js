// You are blindfolded and a deck of cards are placed in front of you on a table. You are allowed to touch the cards, but canâ€™t tell which way up they are by feel. You are told that there are a certain number of cards flipped up, but not which ones are which. This means that there are a certain number of flipped over cards that are randomly distributed throughout the deck, and you know how many (for instance you might have a deck with 13 cards up and 39 face down).

// Can you make two piles of cards each with the same number of heads up? You can flip the cards any number of times. Please explain your reasoning.
