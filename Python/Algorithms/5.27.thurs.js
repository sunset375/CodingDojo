// Problem Statement:
//     Consider a village with vampires and a single sleeping man (who never wakes up).
//     A vampire can eat the sleeping man, but after eating him, the vampire falls asleep.
//     Similarly, any vampire can eat any other sleeping vampire, and this process repeats. (i.e. if they are able and see no risk, they'll eat the sleeping man)
//     Assume that the vampires are very smart and would always choose to stay alive than to eat the man and risk their lives.
//     Initially, there are 65 vampires and 1 sleeping man. What would happen in the village?
